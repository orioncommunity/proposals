# What is the proposal process?

Proposals must follow the process and format specified below to qualify for our governance process.

## Phase 1: Conversations

The starting point of any proposal is a conversation. Discussion of an ORiON Proposal (OP) should take place on Discord, where members can provide opinions on the impact of the OP. There should be clear, observable agreement on an item before entering the next phase. 

## Phase 2: Brainstorming and OP Development

A Discord thread should be created under the **Proposals** category. **Mission Control** should be notified to create a new thread in Discord to facilitate community-wide participation and discussion. The goal is to receive even wider community discussion, review, and comments.

A **Draft** proposal should be created using [this format](https://github.com/orioncommunity/proposals/blob/main/proposal_template.md). Fork this repository, name your file `OP-#` (where # represents is the next proposal to be created). Share the draft proposal in the Discord thread created for review.

Once general consensus is achieved in the Discord thread, submit a Pull Request with your draft proposal.

## Phase 3: Pull Request Review

An OP enters Phase 3 after it has received observable support in the discussion on the Discord thread and a Pull Request has been opened. Within the Pull Request, members will comment for editting requested, approval, or rejection of the draft proposal.

**Time Requirement:** A minimum of 72-hours must pass for all Pull Requests Reviews and before a voting decision is determined.

**Supermajority Requirement:** A vote will be considered passed if it receives at least 66% affirmative votes from reviewers.

## Phase 4: Snapshot Vote and Execution

The OP will then be staged for elevation to [Snapshot](https://vote.orion.security/#/).

The Snapshot proposal will end with a clear vote. Voting must run for **a minimum** of 72-hours before the proposal voting period ends. Ideally, the Snapshot voting period runs for **one week**.

**Supermajority Requirement:** A vote will be considered passed if it receives at least 66% affirmative votes.
